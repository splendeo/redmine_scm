# What is redminde_scm

It's a redmine/chiliptoject plugin for creating Subversion repositories using the web interface.

## How it works

The plugin adds "Create new repository" button to the Subversionrepository addition form (Project » "Settings" » "Repository" » "Subversion"). With just one click on this button a user can create local Subversion/Git repository and register it in Redmine. The plugin also allows to create SVNrepository automatically on project registration.

## Configutation

The configuration file should be placed at `<app_root>/config/scm.yml`. Configuration options are described below:

    production:
      auto_create: false
      deny_delete: true
      svn:
        path: /var/svn
        svnadmin: /usr/bin/svnadmin
        chown:
          user: uid
          group: gid
    

* auto_create: (booelan) indicates if the repository is created automatically on the moment of the project registration.
* deny_delete: (booelan) prevents deleting repositories created with the plugin if set to `true`.
* svn
    * path: indicates the path for creating SVN repositories
    * svnadmin: indicates the path of the `svnadmin` executable
    * options: used for adding options to the `svnadmin` command
    * chown: If the user creating the repositories and the user serving them are different, this option will properly `chmod` the repository.
        * user: Indicates the user that owns the repository files
        * group: Indicates the group that owns the repository files

## Allowing use of sudo for the rails user

If the users serving the rails application and the SVN files are different this plugin requires executing two commands as `sudo`.

In order to allow this, these two lines should be added to the `/etc/sudoers` file:

    %rails_user ALL=(ALL)NOPASSWD:/bin/chown www-data\:subversion /var/svn/* -R
    %rails_user ALL=(ALL)NOPASSWD:/bin/chmod g+w /var/svn/* -R

Here `rails_user` is serving the redmine or chiliproject application while `www-data:subverions` is the one serving the SVN files.
